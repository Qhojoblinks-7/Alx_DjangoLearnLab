# Django Blog Comment System Documentation

## Overview
This Django blog application now includes a comprehensive comment system that allows authenticated users to engage with blog posts through comments. Users can create, read, edit, and delete their own comments, fostering community interaction and discussion.

## Features

### Comment Creation
- Authenticated users can add comments to any blog post
- Inline comment form on post detail pages
- Automatic author assignment to logged-in user
- Success messages upon comment creation

### Comment Display
- All comments displayed under their respective posts
- Comments ordered by creation date (oldest first)
- Comment count shown in post detail headers
- Author name, content, and timestamp displayed
- Edited comments marked with "(edited)" indicator

### Comment Editing
- Comment authors can edit their own comments
- Pre-populated form with existing content
- Updated timestamp tracking
- Permission checking ensures only authors can edit

### Comment Deletion
- Comment authors can delete their own comments
- Confirmation page before deletion
- Success messages after deletion
- Permission checking prevents unauthorized deletion

## Security & Permissions

### Access Control
- **Create**: Requires user authentication
- **Read**: Public access (no authentication required)
- **Update**: Requires authentication + ownership check
- **Delete**: Requires authentication + ownership check

### Permission Implementation
- `login_required` decorator for comment creation
- `UserPassesTestMixin` for edit/delete operations
- Custom `test_func()` method checks if current user is comment author
- Automatic redirect to login for unauthorized access

## Models

### Comment Model
```python
class Comment(models.Model):
    post = models.ForeignKey(Post, on_delete=models.CASCADE, related_name='comments')
    author = models.ForeignKey(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    content = models.TextField()
    created_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
    updated_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now=True)

    class Meta:
        ordering = ['created_at']

    def __str__(self):
        return f'Comment by {self.author.username} on {self.post.title}'
```

## Forms

### CommentForm (`ModelForm`)
- Based on Comment model
- Includes content field only (others auto-assigned)
- Custom textarea widget with styling
- Form validation

## Views

### Comment Views
1. **add_comment** (function-based view)
   - Handles comment creation via POST
   - Requires authentication
   - Redirects to post detail after creation

2. **CommentUpdateView** (`LoginRequiredMixin`, `UserPassesTestMixin`, `UpdateView`)
   - Form for editing existing comments
   - Requires authentication + ownership
   - Redirects to post detail after update

3. **CommentDeleteView** (`LoginRequiredMixin`, `UserPassesTestMixin`, `DeleteView`)
   - Confirmation page for comment deletion
   - Requires authentication + ownership
   - Redirects to post detail after deletion

## URL Patterns

- `/post/<post_id>/comment/` - Add new comment (POST)
- `/comment/<pk>/edit/` - Edit comment
- `/comment/<pk>/delete/` - Delete comment

## Templates

### Post Detail Template Integration
- Comments section added below post content
- Comment count in section header
- Inline comment form for authenticated users
- Login prompt for anonymous users
- Comment list with author, content, and actions

### Comment-Specific Templates
- **comment_form.html**: Edit comment form
- **comment_confirm_delete.html**: Delete confirmation with comment preview

## Styling

### Comment-Specific CSS
- `.comments-section`: Main comments container
- `.add-comment`: Comment creation form styling
- `.comment`: Individual comment card styling
- `.comment-header`: Author and timestamp layout
- `.comment-actions`: Edit/delete links styling
- `.comment-preview`: Delete confirmation preview

## Testing the Comment System

### Manual Testing Checklist

1. **Public Access (Unauthenticated Users)**
   - ✅ Visit post detail page and view existing comments
   - ✅ See comment count in section header
   - ✅ See login prompt instead of comment form
   - ✅ Try accessing edit/delete URLs (should redirect to login)

2. **Comment Creation (Authenticated Users)**
   - ✅ Login with test account
   - ✅ Navigate to post detail page
   - ✅ Fill out and submit comment form
   - ✅ Verify comment appears in list with correct author
   - ✅ Check success message and comment count update

3. **Comment Editing (Comment Authors Only)**
   - ✅ Click "Edit" link on own comment
   - ✅ Modify content and save
   - ✅ Verify changes appear and "(edited)" indicator shows
   - ✅ Try to edit another user's comment (should be denied)

4. **Comment Deletion (Comment Authors Only)**
   - ✅ Click "Delete" link on own comment
   - ✅ Confirm deletion on confirmation page
   - ✅ Verify comment is removed from list
   - ✅ Check comment count updates
   - ✅ Try to delete another user's comment (should be denied)

5. **UI and Navigation**
   - ✅ Verify comments appear in chronological order
   - ✅ Check responsive design on different screen sizes
   - ✅ Test form validation with empty content
   - ✅ Verify CSRF protection on all forms

### Security Testing

1. **URL Manipulation**
   - Try accessing edit/delete URLs with different comment IDs
   - Verify permission checks prevent unauthorized access

2. **Form Security**
   - Check CSRF tokens are present and validated
   - Test form validation with malicious input

3. **Data Integrity**
   - Verify comments are properly linked to posts and authors
   - Test cascade deletion behavior

## Setup Instructions

1. Ensure Django project is set up with authentication system
2. Run migrations: `python manage.py migrate`
3. Start development server: `python manage.py runserver`
4. Access the application at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`

## Sample Data
