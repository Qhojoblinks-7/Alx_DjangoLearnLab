# Django Blog CRUD Features Documentation

## Overview
This Django blog application now includes comprehensive CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality for blog posts. The system allows authenticated users to create, view, edit, and delete their own blog posts, while all users can read published content.

## Features

### Create Posts
- Authenticated users can create new blog posts
- Form includes title and content fields
- Author is automatically assigned to the logged-in user
- Success message displayed after creation

### Read Posts
- Public access to view all published posts
- Post list displays title, author, publication date, and content preview
- Individual post detail view shows full content
- Posts ordered by publication date (newest first)

### Update Posts
- Authors can edit their own posts only
- Pre-populated form with existing content
- Permission checking ensures only post authors can edit
- Success message after update

### Delete Posts
- Authors can delete their own posts only
- Confirmation page before deletion
- Permission checking prevents unauthorized deletion
- Success message after deletion

## Security & Permissions

### Access Control
- **Create**: Requires user authentication (`LoginRequiredMixin`)
- **Read**: Public access (no authentication required)
- **Update**: Requires authentication + ownership check (`UserPassesTestMixin`)
- **Delete**: Requires authentication + ownership check (`UserPassesTestMixin`)

### Permission Implementation
- `LoginRequiredMixin`: Ensures user is logged in for create/update/delete operations
- `UserPassesTestMixin`: Custom `test_func()` method checks if current user is the post author
- Automatic redirect to login page for unauthorized access attempts

## URL Patterns

- `/` - Post list (home page)
- `/post/<id>/` - Post detail view
- `/post/new/` - Create new post (authenticated users only)
- `/post/<id>/edit/` - Edit post (authors only)
- `/post/<id>/delete/` - Delete post (authors only)

## Views

### Class-Based Views Used
1. **PostListView** (`ListView`)
   - Displays all posts ordered by publication date
   - Public access

2. **PostDetailView** (`DetailView`)
   - Shows individual post details
   - Public access

3. **PostCreateView** (`LoginRequiredMixin`, `CreateView`)
   - Form for creating new posts
   - Requires authentication
   - Auto-assigns author

4. **PostUpdateView** (`LoginRequiredMixin`, `UserPassesTestMixin`, `UpdateView`)
   - Form for editing existing posts
   - Requires authentication + ownership

5. **PostDeleteView** (`LoginRequiredMixin`, `UserPassesTestMixin`, `DeleteView`)
   - Confirmation page for post deletion
   - Requires authentication + ownership

## Forms

### PostForm (`ModelForm`)
- Based on Post model
- Includes title and content fields
- Custom widgets with CSS classes
- Form validation

## Templates

### Base Template Updates
- Navigation includes "New Post" link for authenticated users
- Conditional display based on authentication status

### Post-Specific Templates
- **post_list.html**: Card-based layout with action links for post authors
- **post_detail.html**: Full post content with edit/delete links for authors
- **post_form.html**: Reusable form for create/update operations
- **post_confirm_delete.html**: Confirmation dialog for deletions

## Styling

### Enhanced CSS
- Post cards with borders and shadows
- Form styling with proper spacing
- Button styles for different actions
- Responsive design considerations
- Message styling for success/error feedback

## Testing the CRUD System

### Manual Testing Checklist

1. **Public Access (Unauthenticated Users)**
   - ✅ Visit home page and view post list
   - ✅ Click on posts to view details
   - ✅ Try to access create/edit/delete URLs (should redirect to login)

2. **Post Creation (Authenticated Users)**
   - ✅ Login with test account
   - ✅ Click "New Post" link
   - ✅ Fill out and submit the form
   - ✅ Verify post appears in list with correct author
   - ✅ Check success message

3. **Post Editing (Post Authors Only)**
   - ✅ Click "Edit" link on own post
   - ✅ Modify content and save
   - ✅ Verify changes appear in detail view
   - ✅ Try to edit another user's post (should be denied)

4. **Post Deletion (Post Authors Only)**
   - ✅ Click "Delete" link on own post
   - ✅ Confirm deletion on confirmation page
   - ✅ Verify post is removed from list
   - ✅ Try to delete another user's post (should be denied)

5. **Navigation and UI**
   - ✅ Verify "New Post" link appears only for authenticated users
   - ✅ Check that edit/delete links appear only for post authors
   - ✅ Test responsive design on different screen sizes

### Security Testing

1. **URL Manipulation**
   - Try accessing edit/delete URLs with different post IDs
   - Verify permission checks prevent unauthorized access

2. **Form Security**
   - Check CSRF tokens are present and validated
   - Test form validation with invalid data

3. **Session Management**
   - Login, perform CRUD operations, logout
   - Verify session data is properly managed

## Setup Instructions

1. Ensure Django project is set up and authentication system is working
2. Run migrations if any model changes were made
3. Start development server: `python manage.py runserver`
4. Access the application at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`

## Sample Data

The system includes sample posts created during setup:
- "Welcome to Django Blog" by testuser
- "Authentication System" by testuser
- "Getting Started" by testuser

## Future Enhancements

- Post categories/tags
- Rich text editor for post content
- Image upload for posts
- Comments system
- Post search functionality
- Pagination for post lists
- Draft/published status
- Post scheduling
- Social sharing features

## Dependencies

- Django 5.2.7
- Uses Django's built-in class-based views and mixins
- No additional packages required

## Notes

- All views use Django's generic class-based views for consistency
- Permission checks are implemented using Django's mixin system
- Templates use Django template language with conditional rendering
- CSS provides a clean, modern interface
- JavaScript is minimal and used only for basic interactions
